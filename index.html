    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      I am an Industrial Engineer with over 4 year's experience as a Data Analyst and over 10 000 hours of making music.
      <br><br>
      For anything related to my experience as a Data Analyst, please have a look at my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastian-dorrington/"
      target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> page.
      <br><br>
      Being ever curious about how things work and the need to creatively express myself, I embark on small projects that try to marry engineering and music.
      These projects either don't get finished, or have some semblance of a finished idea. Never the less, you will find them all under the
      <a href="creative-coding.html">Creative Coding</a> tab.
      <br><br>
      In order of most proficient to least I play piano, guitar, bass, saxophone and a bit of drums. Currently I use Ableton to produce music. You can find some
      of the songs I've made under the <a href="music.html">My Music</a> tab.
